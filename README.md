# node-api-rocketCourse
API that I created using nodeJS following the NodeJS course in the Rocketseat Website.

I used mongoDB for the database, it was my first experience using a NoSQL database... I trully loved it.
Also used a lot of modules from node, such as express, mongoose, cors, require-dir...
Really want to get into Javascript stacks even more...
For a guy who trully hated this language, I'm pretty addicted now...lol.
